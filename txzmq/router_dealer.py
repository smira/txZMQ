    Base class for all ZMQ connection classes with a uniform interface.

    Subclasses should override sendMsg and sendMultipart with their own
    connection-type specific implementations, which can have a different
    argument signature. Thus, ZmqBase does not attempt to hide away the
    differences between different connection classes--this is simply
    impossible--It simply attempts to provide a more consistent way of
    interacting with them.

    By default, these methods simply delegate to the unerlying low-level
    ZmqConnection.send, which handles both single and multi-part messages.

    Subclasses can/should add their own semantic aliases for sendMsg and
    sendMultipart, such as publish and publishMultipart for a PUB socket.
